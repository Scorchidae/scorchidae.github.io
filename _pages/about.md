  I have long been fascinated by the complexity of ecological systems and the morphological and ecological diversity of marine organisms. From a young age, I have wanted to understand why species live where they do, how they respond to environmental change, and how their behaviors can impact the structure of their ecosystems.

  I study how marine ecosystems function, with a particular focus on how fish and other marine organisms respond to environmental change. I’m interested in the factors that shape species distributions and abundance, how organisms interact within their habitats, and how those interactions scale up to influence whole ecosystems. Much of my work uses ecological modeling to answer questions that are difficult to answer through field observations alone. On this site, you can find more about my research projects, side projects, and the broader questions that motivate my work.
