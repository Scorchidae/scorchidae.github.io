Assessing the Carrying Capcity and Ecological Impacts of Bivalve Aquaculture in a Shallow Estuarine Embayment using Mass-Balanced Modeling
======

&nbsp;Extensive aquaculture of both the hard clam (Mercenaria mercenaria) and the Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) has been rapidly expanding over the past several decades on the east coast of the US. High densities of cultured bivalves and their associated gear cause decreased food availability, increased seafloor structure, and improved water quality, which can subsequently impact the structure of the resident planktonic, benthic and nektonic communities. Cherrystone Inlet, a shallow tidal inlet on Virginia’s Eastern Shore, supports a large-scale hard clam aquaculture industry and an emerging oyster aquaculture industry. As the abundance of cultured bivalves in the system has increased, questions have emerged about their carrying capacity and potential ecological impacts on the estuarine food web. To answer these questions, an ecosystem mass-balance model was adapted to the system parameterized with data from the literature and a series of field surveys. Model outputs suggest that increased cultured bivalve biomass negatively impacts phytoplankton, crustacean and gelatinous zooplankton, filter-feeding fishes, and certain piscivores through both indirect competitive and bottom-up trophic interactions. Results indicate that cultured bivalves reach their ecological carrying capacity and their production carrying capacity at 1.2 - 3.0 times and 6.0 - 7.8 times their current biomass, respectively. Ecological carrying capacity occurs when microzooplankton are grazed out of the system, while production carrying capacity occurs when phytoplankton have been grazed out of the system and cultured bivalves have become food limited. The use of ecological carrying capacities quantified here would maintain the ecological sustainability of the aquaculture industry in this system.
