Assessing the Carrying Capcity and Ecological Impacts of Bivalve Aquaculture in a Shallow Estuarine Embayment using Mass-Balanced Modeling
======
My senior honors thesis was my largest independent research project to date and focused on evaluating the ecological impacts of shellfish aquaculture in a shallow tidal creek using the Ecopath with Ecosim modeling framework. The project required me to develop a full research proposal and secure funding to support fieldwork in the summer of 2024 which would be used to inform the model. Through this experience, I learned how to design a robust research plan and carry it out to completion. While working on this project, I had the privilege of working closely with multiple faculty from the Virginia Institute of Marine Science, where I learned how to effectively communicate with colleagues in a professional academic environment and gained a solid understanding of the daily workings of a research institute. I also acquired a wealth of experience mining the literature for project-relevant data, and analyzing a variety of large data sets. Another important aspect of this project was organizing and leading fieldwork, which helped me develop strong leadership and people management skills. Leading fieldwork was especially important for developing my ability to be adaptable and open to pursuing other methods when a data collection or analysis method doesn’t go as planned. After analyzing the data and creating a balanced ecosystem model, I wrote and defended a 60-page thesis and presented my work at a symposium. This experience strengthened my skills in ecological modeling, data analysis, and communication, and it showed me that I enjoy the process of using models to explore ecosystem-level questions that cannot be answered through empirical observation alone.
