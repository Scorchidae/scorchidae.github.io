&nbsp;Developing an Educational Marine Videogame
======

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the past several years, I have been planning the development of a marine life video game that I believe has great potential for both recreation and education. The game simulates the behavior and interactions of fishes and other marine organisms in 3D using agent-based modeling concepts. While the project is creative in nature, it has strong educational potential as a tool for teaching ecological principles to students and the public using an engaging medium. Determining which aspects of real life ecosystems are the most important to include in order to create an interesting game while also maintaining high scientific accuracy has been an especially engaging challenge.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overfished is a 3D, third person, PvE marine game that depicts a variety of marine organisms with realistic animal behaviors and ecology based on scientific literature, along with realistic maps based on the geology of various marine environments. In it, you play as a singular multicellular marine organism, starting from the larval stage and growing as your life progresses, with the goal of surviving to adulthood and reproducing in a dynamic marine environment. You gain currency slowly as time progresses and gain large sums of currency by successfully reproducing. Currency is added to your account after your run is over and can be used to unlock new species and classes of marine organism. By eating other organisms during your run, you gain unique abilities inherent to your species or class of organism. A key major point of Overfished is that it encourages using a playstyle accurate to your chosen organism by implementing realistic predation strategies of predatory organisms.
