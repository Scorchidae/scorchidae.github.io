Developing an Educational Marine Videogame
======

During the summer after graduation, I dedicated a great deal of time to developing a marine life video game, which is a project I have been roadmapping for several years. The game simulates the behavior and interactions of fishes and other marine organisms in 3D using agent-based modeling concepts. While the project is creative in nature, it has strong educational potential as a tool for teaching ecological principles to students and the public using an engaging medium. Determining which aspects of real life ecosystems are the most important to include in order to create an interesting game while also maintaining high scientific accuracy has been an especially engaging challenge. In addition to strengthening my programming and 3D modeling skills, this project represents how I enjoy communicating science in innovative ways, and I hope will increase public scientific literacy and public outreach in the marine sciences and ecology, which are at the forefront of my career goals.
